# Stack
Stack follows **Last In First Out**
Browser back button has same principle of stack
As Stack is logical data structure it can be implemented using array or linked list(physical DS)
## Array Vs List implementation
|DS         |Pros   |Cons |
|---        |------ |-----|
|Array      | 'Easy to implement' |'fixed size (or) even in the case of dynamic
                                    array time complexity to increase the size is more'|
|Linked List|       |     |
## Operations
* CreateStack()
* push()
* pop()
* peak()
* isEmpty()
* isFull()
* DeleteStack()
