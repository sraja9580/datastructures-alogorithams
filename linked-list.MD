# Linked List
A inked list is a linear data structure where each element is a separate object.Each element(node) of list comprises of tow items - the data and reference to the next node.The most powerful feature of Linked List is that it is of variable size.<br>
We can compare linked list to a train,each node to a compartment, even if we remove comportment(node) train(linked list)  will still work.
Train always starts with engine and ends with guard room,same ways Liked list always starts with head and ends with tail.
