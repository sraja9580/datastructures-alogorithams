#Linked List
A inked list is a linear data structure where each element is a separate object.Each element(node) of list comprises of tow items - the data
and reference to the next node.The most powerful feature of Linked List is that it is of variable size.
We can compare linked list to a train,each node to a compartment, even if we remove comportment(node) train(linked list)  will still work.
**Node** Contains Data and Reference to next Node
**Head** Reference to first Node in the list.
**Tail** Reference to last node of the list.
