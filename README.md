  **Primitive**  
        Int,flot <br>
  **Non Primitive** 
          physical ->Arrays and List<br>
	  Logical  -> Depends on physical data structure for implementation (Stack,Queue,Tree)
## Algorithm Runtime analysis
  measurement of performance of given algorithm
  
  **Notations**    
      Omega Ω - lower bound of given algorithm (at the best case what is the minimum time taken)
      Big-o O - upper bound of an algorithm (worst case maximum time taken)
      Theta θ - average time taken
      
  ### Run Time analysis for searching element array.
  ![DS](/images/array-of-numbers.PNG) <br>
  if array has n elements, below are best , worst and average run timr
  	* min: Ω(1)
 	* max: O(1)
  	* avg: θ(n/2)
	
  ### Examples of Algorithm run time complexities
  in the below graph you dont see blue line O(1), beacause it is always 1.Adding element in the front of linked list alwasy takes O(1)
