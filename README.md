## Algorithm Runtime analysis
  measurement of performance of given algorithm
  
  **Notations**  
  
      Omega Ω - lower bound of given algorithm (at the best case what is the minimum time taken)
      Big-o O - upper bound of an algorithm (worst case maximum time taken)
      Theta θ - average time taken
      
  ### Run Time analysis for searching element array.

  if array has n elements, below are best , worst and average run timr
  min: Ω(1)
  max: O(1)
  avg: θ(n/2)
