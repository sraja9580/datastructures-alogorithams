  **Primitive**  
        Int,flot <br>
  **Not Primitive** 
          physical ->Arrays and List<br>
		      Logical  -> Depends on physical data structure for implementation (Stack,Queue,Tree)
## Algorithm Runtime analysis
  measurement of performance of given algorithm
  
  **Notations**  
  
      Omega Ω - lower bound of given algorithm (at the best case what is the minimum time taken)
      Big-o O - upper bound of an algorithm (worst case maximum time taken)
      Theta θ - average time taken
