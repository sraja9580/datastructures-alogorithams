# Binary Tree
## Tree Properties
	* Used to represent data in hierarchical form
	* Every Node(ideally) has 2 components (Data & Reference)
	* It has a root node and 2 disjoint binary tree called Left subtree and Right subtree

## Tree Terminologies
* [Root](#root)	<br> 
	Node with no parents<br> 
* [Edge](#edge)	<br>
	Link from parent to child <br> 
* [Leaf](#leaf)	<br>
	Node with no children <br>
* [Sibling](#sibling)<br>	
	Children of same parent<br> 
* [Ancestor](#ancestor)	<br>
	 means parent,grant-parent,great grant-parent, and so on for the given node<br>

* [Depth of Node](#depth-of-node)<br>
	Length of path from root node(ie no of edges)<br>
* [Hight of Node](#hight-of-node)<br>
	 Length of path from node to the deepest node<br>
* [Hight of Tree](#hight-of-tree)<br>
	Same as hight of root node <br> 
* [Depth of Tree](#depth-of-tree)<br>
	 Same as Depth of root node which will be always 0<br>

* [Predecessor](#predecessor)<br>
	Predecessor of the node is the immediate previous node in inorder traversal of a binary tree.<br>

* [Successor](#successor)<br><br>
	Successor of the node is the immediate next node in inorder traversal of a binary tree.<br>

## What is Binary Tree
* Tree in which each node can have up to two children(0 or 1 or 2),but not more than two.
* BST,Heap Tree,AVL are type of binary tree <br>

## Why is Binary Tree
* Prerequisite for more advanced trees(BST,AVL,Red-Black)
* Is used in solving problems like
	* Huffman coding
	* Heap(Priority queue)
	* Expression parsing
