# Binary Tree
## Tree Properties
	* Used to represent data in hierarchical form
	* Every Node(ideally) has 2 components (Data & Reference)
	* It has a root node and 2 disjoint binary tree called Left subtree and Right subtree

## Tree Terminologies
* [Root](#root)		
* [Edge](#edge)				
* [Leaf](#leaf)		
* [Sibling](#sibling)		
* [Ancestor](#ancestor)		
* [Depth of Node](#depth-of-node)		
* [Hight of Node](#hight-of-node)	
* [Hight of Tree](#hight-of-tree)	
* [Depth of Tree](#depth-of-tree)		
* [Predecessor](#predecessor)		
* [Successor](#successor)

## Root
 Node with no parents<br> 
## Edge
 Link from parent to child <br> 
## Leaf
 Node with no children <br> 
## Sibling
 Children of same parent<br>  
## Ancestor
 means parent,grant-parent,great grant-parent, and so on for the given node<br> 	
## Depth of Node
 Length of path from root node(ie no of edges)	<br> 
## Hight of Node
 Length of path from node to the deepest node<br>  
## Hight of Tree
 Same as hight of root node <br> 
## Depth of Tree
 Same as Depth of root node which will be always 0<br> 
## Predecessor
 Predecessor of the node is the immediate previous node in inorder traversal of a binary tree.<br>

## Successor
 Successor of the node is the immediate next node in inorder traversal of a binary tree.<br>
